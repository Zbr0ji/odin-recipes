        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Zoodle spaghetti with turkey meat sauce makes a light yet satisfying meal that's full of fabulous flavor. This sauce works equally well with pasta (or a combo of pasta and zoodles) if you prefer.</p>
            <p>Zoodle spaghetti with turkey meat sauce has a lot going for it. Spiralized zucchini gets flash-saut√©ed to crisp-tender perfection and then blanketed in a flavorful, hearty but not heavy turkey meat sauce.</p>
