        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These sticky honey glazed chicken drumsticks are finger-licking good!! The honey-soy glaze make the drumsticks so flavorful and completely irresistible. These are amazing served with steamy white rice and vegetables. We LOVE chicken drumsticks in our house chicken legs are inexpensive and easily feed a crowd.</p>
            <p>These baked chicken drumsticks literally show up on the menu every other Sunday! This recipe makes a big batch of chicken legs and you can cut down the recipe for a smaller crew, but I personally always make the big pack of drumsticks and if we are lucky enough to have leftovers, they make for a great quick lunch the next day.</p>
